	<blockquote>
		<p style="text-align:center">To be honest, when starting this quarter and this class I wasn't sure whether I would end up enjoying it or not. I was very nervous because I've never written any code before and without any experience this class seemed like a daunting task. Fortunately as I started to get more familiar with the subject, I realized that it might not be as difficult as I originally imagined. Although I wouldn't necessarily call coding HTML and CSS an easy task, I feel like I eventually started to understand the formula of working with code and tags.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">I'm really glad I decided to take this class. Even though I was a little nervous at first, I think that feeling was a good source of motivation for me throughout the quarter. My performance this quarter pleasantly surprised me. I think I tried a little bit harder because I was the only student in the class, so I felt like my grade might stand out a little bit more if it was poor.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">I think going forward I'm going to continue learning html on my own. Although this was the only class required for me to take in the subject, I find that html is a very important language to be comfortable with even if you want to explore other coding languages. Even though I want to major in something more artistic, in order to present the material that I create I will need to know basic Web formatting skills.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">In the future I would like to explore more about how html interacts with other coding languages. I feel like the material I learned in this course opened up a lot of doors for me to expand my knowledge and ability in a huge variety of ways. I'm excited to see what else I can learn, Thank you so much for allowing me take this class as a special project! </p>
