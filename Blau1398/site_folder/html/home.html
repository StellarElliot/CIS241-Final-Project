		<p style="text-align:center">Hello, my name is <em>Elliot Blaufuss</em>, I am a relatively new student to the Web design space. Although I haven't been learning HTML andd CSS for very long, I am starting to feel more comfortable using them to create and format Web pages. Figuring out new creative ways to design a site using HTML and CSS can actually be pretty fun. After this class, I look forward to expanding my knowledge on the subject even further!</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">I started attending <strong>Edmonds Community College</strong> in the Fall of 2017 and am going to be finished taking classes here after this quarter. When I graduate, I am going to transfer to The University of Washington Bothell and pursue a degree in video design and animation. I am excited to continue my education and take more classes in my field! Hopefully the transition is both easy and smooth!</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">Before moving to Lynnwood, Washington for college, I lived in a smaller town in Washington called Wenatchee. Wenatchee is about 130 miles to the East of Lynnwood. Living over there was nice, but there was never much to do in such a small town. I think I strongly prefer living Lynnwood because it seems like there is always something going on pretty close by and it is not as difficult to travel to downtown.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">In my free time my favorite thing to do is create digital art and animation. I have always enjoyed drawing and within the last few years I have been taking my interest to the computer in hopes of some day getting a job in the field of graphic design or animation. My favorite thing to draw is cute and funny characters, pictured below are a few examples of my recent work!</p>
